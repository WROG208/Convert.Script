# Convert Script

A script to convert text to speech using gTTS and save the output in G.711 Âµ-law format for Asterisk/Allstar systems.

## Prerequisites

The script will ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.5.1
- pip 20.3.4
- ffmpeg 3.0

If you are installing in GMRSlive, these prerequisites are already met, with one exception: gTTS.  
I've included information below on gTTS.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/WROG208/convert-script.git
cd convert-script

```
### Step 2: Run the Install Script
```
sudo ./install.sh
```
The install script will copy the convert.py script to /usr/local/sbin/ and make it executable


### Usage
After installation, you can use the script by running this command in the BASH-SHELL: 
```
convert.py 
```

The script will make sure you have in your system :
```
ffmpeg version 3.0
Python 3.5.1
pip 20.3.4
```
You will not have gTTS installed in your system Google Text To Speach (gTTS). The script will download and install gTTS on your system unattended.

### After installation of gTTS.

You will be prompted
```
Enter the text you want to convert to speech: "TEXT YOU WANT TO CONVERT TO SPEACH"

Enter the desired output file name (without extension): FILE NAME NET for a net announcement, news?

Do you want the speech in [E]nglish or [S]panish? - E FOR ENGLISH S FOR SPANISH
```
The script will run by making a >WAV file first and converting that WAV file to .ul that asterisk can use.

The audio files will be saved to the folder /var/lib/asterisk/sounds  sound files can be found easily by the OS.

[NOTE]***GSM files would be better, but ffmpeg version 3.0 doesn't have the ability to create GSM files unless it is updated and there are many hoops to jump to install it.
